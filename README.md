Howdy! Pixel clicker is a website/videogame! The game isn't 100%, but logging in WITH react sure is!

# Credit
We got special permission from Atoxme on soundcloud to use his music on the website! We also have cute icons made by our very own Vanessa!

# Usage
This application used React for all of the front-end and used Redux to connect the backend to it!

1. Go ahead and make a a very simple user account. Everything is encrypted, so don't worry about us seeing your password!
2. Log in! You're logged in for an entire year unless you wipe your cookies.
3. If you ever want to log out, go into your profile page and just click "log out"!
4. Go to the game page to play! It's a small version of cookie clicker! (points dont work)

Unfortunately our leaderboard doesn't work quite yet!
